<h1>🛒 StyleCart - Modern React E-Commerce Frontend ⚛️</h1>

A dynamic, single-page application (SPA) e-commerce frontend built entirely with React.js. This project focuses on delivering a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience, mimicking a real-world online store. It leverages modern React features like Hooks, Context API, and React Router for seamless navigation and state management.
